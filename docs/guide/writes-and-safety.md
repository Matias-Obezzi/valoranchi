# Writes and Safety

All state mutations in `@valoranchi/riot-client` are governed by a strict local validation layer. Before any HTTP request is dispatched to Riot PVP servers, your current session state, inventory, balances, and party conditions are evaluated locally.

If a requested mutation violates game constraints, a `ValidationError` is thrown immediately and zero network traffic is sent.

## The Validation Model

The validation system acts as a protective shield:

1. **Local Pre-flight Check**: Gathers active player data (owned items, party state, match lobby, wallet).
2. **Constraint Enforcement**: Checks ownership, currency requirements, state prerequisites, and format rules.
3. **Dual Confirmation Guard**: Enforces explicit opt-in for disruptive or irreversible operations.
4. **Network Dispatch**: Transmits the request only when all validation checks succeed.

## Validation Reasons Grouped by Area

When a validation rule fails, the library raises a `ValidationError` containing a machine-readable `reason`, a descriptive `message`, and contextual `details`.

## Dry-Run by Default in CLI

In the CLI, every write command runs in **dry-run** mode by default. It validates the operation locally, outputs the validated body (with credentials excluded) to stdout, and exits with code 0 without executing any network mutations.

Pass `--yes` to authorize the mutation:

```bash
# Dry run: validates locally and outputs the intended PUT payload
riotclient equip --card 0819fbcd-4bd4-c379-5384-52803440f2b2

# Execute mutation: sends the validated request
riotclient equip --card 0819fbcd-4bd4-c379-5384-52803440f2b2 --yes
```

## Explicit Confirmation for Destructive Actions

Disruptive operations require explicit dual confirmation to prevent unintended purchases or match penalties.

The operations requiring explicit confirmation are:
1. **Purchases** (`store.buy` / `riotclient buy`)
2. **Dodging Agent Select** (`matches.dodge` / `riotclient dodge`)
3. **Leaving In-Game Match** (`matches.leaveMatch` / `riotclient leave-match`)
4. **Overwriting Cloud Settings** (`account.saveSettings` / `riotclient settings-save`)

In Node, pass `{ confirm: true }`:

```ts
await client.store.buy({ offerId: "offer-uuid" }, { confirm: true });
await client.matches.dodge({ confirm: true });
await client.matches.leaveMatch({ confirm: true });
await client.account.saveSettings(newSettings, { confirm: true });
```

From the CLI, pass both `--yes` and `--confirm`:

```bash
riotclient buy --offer <id> --yes --confirm
riotclient dodge --yes --confirm
riotclient leave-match --yes --confirm
riotclient settings-save <file.json> --yes --confirm
```

If `--confirm` is omitted on these operations, the command fails with exit code `6` and `reason: confirm-required`.

## What the Library Refuses to Do

To preserve account safety and integrity, the library enforces strict operational boundaries:

- **No automated gameplay or bots**: The library does not orchestrate gameplay inputs or match automation.
- **No telemetry logging**: Access tokens, session cookies, and credentials are never stored, logged, or sent to telemetry.
- **No unconfirmed transactions**: No currency transaction can ever be triggered implicitly or without explicit confirmation.
- **No arbitrary player lookup without presence**: Arbitrary player search by `Name#Tag` (`social.lookup`) is not supported because Riot player-data endpoints do not expose lookup outside mutual presence or match history.
